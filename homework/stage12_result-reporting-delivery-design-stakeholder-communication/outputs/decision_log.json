    "Step": "Outlier Handling",
    "Decision": "Winsorize at 10th/90th percentiles",
    "Rationale": "Reduces undue leverage from extreme points while retaining overall distribution shape.",
    "Alternatives": "None; Winsorize at 5th/95th",
    "Risk": "If extreme values represent true business conditions, we may understate risk/volatility.",
    "Impact": "Improved MAE vs 'none'; directionally consistent coefficients across scenarios."
